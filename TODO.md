# TODO
As I am likely to forget what I was doing the last time I worked on this project, I need this file to know what to do after.
You can just forget this file.

## ASAP
Create Managers class for all folders (as it was just rearranged)
+ Delete OpenGL references in the texture loader

## Peripherals
Make the customs objets for the mouse/keyboard and, with a bit of luck, controller.

## GUI
Make the bitmap display work
Continue the GameTexLoader (scan the Assets folder and import all the textures)
Remove ALL occurencies of OpenGL outside the Window class (why not a Display class ?)

## Rooms
Create the generator
(Make a breadth-first fill with)
